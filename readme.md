# This is Face Recognition Attendance System using Python

We are Team 2 from AUPP IT Club. In spring, semester 2024, we are working on a project to develop a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python. The team members are:
- ENG Chanveasna
- HEANG Tong
- HENG Shito
- HORNG Linda
- DIEP Thavy

This project is mainly for the purpose of learning and practicing Python programming language. We are using the following libraries:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

The project is divided into 3 main parts:
1. Face Detection & Face Recognition
2. Attendance System
3. User Interface

We are using the following steps to develop the project:
1. Research
2. Planning
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Documentation
6. Presentation

## Research
We found some similar project on github that utilize the same libraries. We are using the following projects as reference:
1. [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
2. [Face Attendance System](https://github.com/computervisioneng/face-atendance-system)
3. [Face_Recognition_Project](https://github.com/Chando0185/face_recognition_project)

## Planning
We have planned the project and divided the tasks among the team members. We have created a project plan and a timeline to follow.

## Coding
We are in the Coding phase now. We will update the progress of the project in this file.
